| APIKEY  | The CiviCRM API key of the contact you wish to use for performing API calls.                        |

### Configure CiviCRM

- Go to the Administration console `/civicrm/admin`
- Open "betterplace.org Direkt API Configuration" at
  `/civicrm/admin/settings/betterplace`

#### Configure a contact for administrative activities

Open "Configure extension settings" at
`/civicrm/admin/settings/betterplace/settings` and provide the CiviCRM ID of the
contact that will receive the activities.

#### Configure profiles

Open "Configure profiles" at `/civicrm/admin/settings/betterplace/profiles`.

The *default* profile is used whenever the plugin cannot match the
betterplace.org Direkt form id from any other profile. Therefore the default
profile will be used for all newly created betterplace.org Direkt forms.
